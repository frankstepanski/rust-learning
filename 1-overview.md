## Overview

Rust compiles to either machine code or WebAssembly.

You can build with Rust:

 - web servers
 - command-line interfaces
 - native desktop applications
 - in-browser app (WebAssembly)
 - Operating Systems

 Rust is all about performance (c/c++ level performance).

 Rust has a built-in package manager and code formatter.

 Rust is either dynamically or statically typed:
 - static: defined before you assign
 - dynamic: desfined after you assign (cannot re-assign)

Rust drawbacks:
 - large codebase to learn
 - strict compiler (i.e. borrow checker errors)
 - slow compiler (i.e. long test build)
 - Elm is a good alternaive if speed is not top priority

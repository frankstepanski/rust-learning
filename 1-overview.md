## Overview

Rust compiles to either machine code or WebAssembly.

You can build with Rust:

 - web servers
 - command-line interfaces
 - native desktop applications
 - in-browser app (WebAssembly)
 - Operating Systems

 Rust is all about performance (c/c++ level performance).

 Rust has a built-in package manager and code formatter.

 Rust can allows for a dynamically typed and statically types:
   - define types before assignment (errors at compile time)
   - types are determined at assignment (error at runtime)

Rust drawbacks:
 - large codebase to learn
 - strict compiler (i.e. borrow checker errors)
 - slow compiler (i.e. long test build)
 - Elm is a good alternaive if speed is not top priority

### Data Types:

Primitives
 - strings
 - floats
 - integers
 - booleans

## Install

### Rust and Cargo

https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html

`curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh`

## Overview

Rust compiles to either machine code or WebAssembly.

You can build with Rust:

 - web servers
 - command-line interfaces
 - native desktop applications
 - in-browser app (WebAssembly)
 - Operating Systems

 Rust is all about performance (c/c++ level performance).

 Rust has a built-in package manager and code formatter.

 Rust is either dynamically or statically typed:
 - static: defined before you assign
 - dynamic: desfined after you assign (cannot re-assign)
